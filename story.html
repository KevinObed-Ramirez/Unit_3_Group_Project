         <p>One day Jimmy Torres was going to church when he realized he accidentally got ready for work instead of being ready to praise the Lord.</p>
         <p>With this given problem he sought out to find an easier way to change into clothes for different situations.</p>
         <p>Jimmy thought to himself “I hate having to take so much time to change”.</p>
         <p>He had to go to school, West-Mec, then work and all of that combined was very time consuming.</p>
         <p>It took trial and error for Jimmy to conceive the idea of creating a watch that can change outfits at an instant.</p>
         <p>Then came forth the creation of Nice fit; </p>
         <p>a portable wardrobe that is easy to access and use.</p>
